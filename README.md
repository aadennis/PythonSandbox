Generate some random data (using Python)

VSCode was evidently the IDE I used, in a PowerShell terminal.

Example:
python .\DataGenerator.py

Ctrl-Z is how you quit an interactive session.

Debugging Python in VS code:

F9 as usual for setting breakpoint; bug icon; Add Configuration; [Python File]

And you get tooltip watches and a watch window - great.
